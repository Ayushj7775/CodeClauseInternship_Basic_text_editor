A text editor is a software application or program designed for creating, editing, and managing text-based documents. Text editors are versatile tools used for a wide range of tasks, from writing and editing plain text to coding and scripting. Here's a description of the key components and features commonly found in text editors:

Text Editing Interface: At its core, a text editor provides a user-friendly interface for entering and manipulating text. It typically presents a blank canvas where you can type, delete, and modify text characters.

Minimal Formatting: Unlike word processors, text editors focus on plain text with minimal formatting options. While you can apply basic formatting like bold or italic text in some text editors, they lack the advanced formatting features found in word processors.

Plain Text Documents: Text editors primarily work with plain text documents, which are free from complex formatting, fonts, and styles. Common file formats include .txt, .md (Markdown), and .html (for web development).

Syntax Highlighting: Many text editors offer syntax highlighting, which color-codes different elements of code or markup languages. This feature improves code readability by distinguishing keywords, strings, comments, and variables.

Customization: Text editors often allow users to customize the interface, themes, fonts, and color schemes to suit their preferences. This helps create a comfortable and personalized working environment.

Search and Replace: Text editors include search and replace functionality, enabling you to search for specific words or phrases within your document and replace them with others. This is useful for making global changes.

Line Numbers: Line numbers are commonly displayed on the left side of the text editor, making it easy to reference and navigate to specific lines in a document, especially for code files.

Undo/Redo: Text editors typically offer an undo/redo feature, allowing you to revert or redo changes made to the document.
